## Project structure {#project-structure}

Assuming you chose the classic template and named your site `my-website`, you will see the following files generated under a new directory `my-website/`:

```sh

## Project structure rundown {#project-structure-rundown}

- `/blog/` - Contains the blog Markdown files. You can delete the directory if you do not want/need a blog. More details can be found in the [blog guide]
- `/docs/` - Contains the Markdown files for the docs. Customize the order of the docs sidebar in `sidebars.js`. More details can be found in the [docs guide]
- `/src/` - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components. You don't have to strictly put your non-documentation files in here but putting them under a centralized directory makes it easier to specify in case you need to do some sort of linting/processing
  - `/src/pages` - Any files within this directory will be converted into a website page. More details can be found in the [pages guide]
- `/static/` - Static directory. Any contents inside here will be copied into the root of the final `build` directory
- `/docusaurus.config.js` - A config file containing the site configuration. This is the equivalent of `siteConfig.js` in Docusaurus v1
- `/package.json` - A Docusaurus website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you like in them
- `/sidebar.js` - Used by the documentation to specify the order of documents in the sidebar
